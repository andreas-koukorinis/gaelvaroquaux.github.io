Massively univariate analysis of a motor task from the Localizer dataset
========================================================================

This example shows the results obtained in a massively univariate
analysis performed at the inter-subject level with various methods.
We use the [left button press (auditory cue)] task from the Localizer
dataset and seek association between the contrast values and a variate
that measures the speed of pseudo-word reading. No confounding variate
is included in the model.

1. A standard Anova is performed. Data smoothed at 5 voxels FWHM are used.

2. A permuted Ordinary Least Squares algorithm is run at each voxel. Data
   smoothed at 5 voxels FWHM are used.
