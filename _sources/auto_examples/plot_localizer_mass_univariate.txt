Massively univariate analysis of a computation task from the Localizer dataset
==============================================================================

A permuted Ordinary Least Squares algorithm is run at each voxel in
order to determine which voxels are specifically active when a healthy subject
performs a computation task as opposed to a sentence reading task.

The example shows the small differences that exist between
Bonferroni-corrected p-values and family-wise corrected p-values obtained
from a permutation test combined with a max-type procedure.
Bonferroni correction is a bit conservative, as it detects less significant
voxels than the non-parametric, exact permutation test.
